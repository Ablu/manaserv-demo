monsters.xml parameters explanation:
This file is used to describe the monsters the players will see all around the world.
It can be used by both client and server, but some parameters are specific.

id [integer]:      It is the id of the monster. This parameter has to be unique for each monster.
                   The system will use the monster id to refer on it in many ways.
name [string]:     Tells the monster name. (Used to ease configuration ease on server.)
                   but displayed to players on the client side.
sprite [xml file]: Tells the xml file used to display the monster sprites. (Client only).
sound <TAG>:       This tag is used by the client to know which sound to play at what event.
  event [string]:  Tells the event at which the corresponding sound should be played. ('die', 'miss', 'hit', 'strike' are some examples.)
  <INNER>[string]: The ogg file to be played
drop <TAG>:        Tells what kind of item the monster can drop. See items.xml to get the id correspondence.
  item [integer]:  Tells the drop item Id.
  percent[float]:  Tells the chance (8.0 = 8%) to see the drop after monster's death.
attributes <TAG>:  Tells all the monsters attribute. These attribute, as for items, should not be left
                   in players hands.
  hp [integer]:    The monster hit points.
  size[integer]:   The monster maximal amplitude in pixels. Used to compute player's hit area.
  speed[float]:    The monster's speed in tiles per second.
                       (A tile is the smallest square map unit: by default, a tile is 32 pixel long.)
  attack-min[integer]: The minimal attack strength of the monster. If your hasn't got any armor,
                          there are the minimal hit points he will lose when hit by the monster.
  attack-delta[integer]:  The amplitude between minimal and maximal damages the monster can do.
  attack-magic[integer]:  The magical attacks are removing hp when hit but are computed against magical defense instead.
  mutation[integer]:      The mutation indicates the amplitude in percent where attributes get modified with.
                          For instance, with a mutation of 50, each attribute can be altered to become 100% to 149% of what they are.
vulnerability<TAG>:       Tells the monster specific vulnerability to an element.
  element[string]:        Tells to which element the weakness is. ('fire', 'earth', 'ice', 'metal' are some examples.)
  factor[float]:          Tells the defense against an element is reduced in percent. (A value of 0.7 indicates that the defense is lowered by 30%).
exp<TAG>:                 Tells how much experience point a monster is giving upon victory.
