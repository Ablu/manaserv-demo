    Script for letting npcs walk defined routes

    To use create an npc and call:
      setWaypoints(npc, points, walkspeed, callback)
    being: being which should walk
    walkspeed: walkingspeed in tiles per second
    callback: function that should get called as soon the being reaches a point

--]]

local waypoints = {}

local function getWalkTime(being, x, y)
    local speed = being_get_modified_attribute(being, ATTRIBUTE_MOVEMENT_SPEED)
    local dist = get_distance(posX(being), posY(being),
                                   x, y) / TILESIZE
    return dist / speed
end

--- Setup the walking route of an npc.
-- The npc will walk along the given route, and restart from first waypoint after the last is reached.
-- @param npc The npc which should move along a route
-- @param points An array with tables as entries. One entry should have
--               x=integer in pixel coordinates, y=integer in pixel coordinates,
--               time=float in seconds, how long to wait upon arrival.
--               id=string this id will be additionally passed to callback
-- @param walkspeed The speed this npc should use
-- @param callback Function to be called when the next waypoint is reached.
--                 Easiest case would be 'function() gotoNextWaypoint(npc) end'
--                 to keep the npc walking to the next waypoint after arriving
--                 the current waypoint.
